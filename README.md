# Mathesar

Mathesar is a project to make databases easier to use for non-technical users. Our aim is to help users of all skill levels store, manipulate, visualize, and collaborate with others on data.

We are currently in early development and hope to release an alpha version by late 2021. Please see the [Mathesar wiki](https://wiki.mathesar.org/) for more information about the project.

## Local Development

First, [ensure that you have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` like so:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

From the repository's root directory, run:
```
docker-compose up
```
You should now have a web server and database server running. Opening `http://localhost:8000` in your browser will open the application.

If it's your first time running the application, you'll also need to run database migrations and install Mathesar types and functions:
```
docker exec mathesar_web_1 python manage.py migrate
docker exec -it mathesar_web_1 python install.py
```

If you want to use Mathesar with a preexisting Postgres DB, modify the `DATABASES.mathesar_tables` entry of the `config/settings.py` file with appropriate connection details before installing the Mathesar types and functions with the previous step.

### Running tests

If you'd like to run tests before pushing, here's how you do it:

Backend tests:
```
docker exec mathesar_web_1 pytest
```

Frontend tests:
```
docker exec mathesar_ui_1 npm test
```

### Opening a shell in the container

If you need to do some work on the container that's running the code, here's how you access it:

Backend:
```
docker exec -it mathesar_web_1 bash
```

Frontend:
```
docker exec -it mathesar_ui_1 bash
```
